\section{Feature formulation and preprocessing}
\subsection{Features} What are the features you feed to your learning algorithm? Did you simply flatten the 7 rows into a vector for features? Did you transform or aggregate the given data to engineer your own features?

\subsection{Preprocessing}
Did you pre-process your data in any way? This can be for the purpose of reducing dimension, or reducing noise, or balancing the class distribution. Be clear about what you exactly did. The criterion is to allow others to replicate your works.

\section{Learning algorithms}
\subsection{Algorithms explored}
Provide a list of learning algorithms that you explored for this project. For each algorithm, briefly justify your rationale for choosing this algorithm.
\subsubsection{Linear Regression}
Since we are looking for a correlation between features such as time of day, blood sugar level, etc. and whether a subject has a hypoglycemic episode, linear regression will allow us to calculate a line that best fits the training data to predict the outcome based on the features.
\subsubsection{K Nearest Neighbor}
Similar to linear regression, the relationship of the features are telling of whether a subject will have a hypoglycemic episode. Therefore, we are using k nearest neighbor to find instances most similar to the test instances to predict the outcome.
\subsection{Final models}
What are the final models that produced your submitted test predictions?

\section{Parameter Tuning and Model Selection }
\subsection{Parameter Tuning}
What parameters did you tune for your models? How do you perform the parameter tuning?

\subsection{Model selection}
How did you decide which models to use to produce the final predictions?  Do you use cross-validation or hold-out for model selection? When you split the data for validation, is it fully random or special consideration went into forming the folds? What criterion is used to select the models?

\section{Results}
Do you have any internal evaluation results you want to report?
